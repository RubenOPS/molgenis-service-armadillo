# To develop the docs

You can run following the [UI docs](../ui/README.md) section. Then there
is no need for installing docsify globally.

## Install docsify

Install docsify

```bash
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

## Serve

Then you can serve the dev in this directory using

```bash
docsify serve ./docs
```

## View
```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Github pages

We have this configured through github pages instead of custom actions:
