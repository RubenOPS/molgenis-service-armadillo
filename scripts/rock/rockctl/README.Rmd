# Rock stats

For this to work you need to copy `dist.env` to `.env` and check its values

## Status

- clean checkout
- renv did not run automagical from RStudio
- in shell had to manual run `Rscript .Rprofile` which did something but not enough

```
Rscript .Rprofile
Rscript -e 'renv::status()'
Rscript -e '?renv'
Rscript -e 'renv::install()'
```
seemed to fix it


We use [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) for dependency management.

## Running

```r
./src/rockctl.R
```
## Renv workflow

### Once

Run this on a new project.

``` r
renv::init()
```

### Install packages

The normal way.

### Status

renv::status()

### Snapshot

set the version using the install option if asked for.

renv::snapshot()
